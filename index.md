## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I’m a 10th-grade student at TÜBİTAK Science High School (TÜBİTAK Fen Lisesi). I’m interested in programming, robotics, mechanics, and electronics, and I love making projects and applications in these fields.

Over the years, I’ve been actively involved in robotics competitions like FRC and Teknofest, where I’ve led teams and contributed as the programming lead. My experience includes designing autonomous systems, working with MAVLink protocols, and exploring creative ways to combine technology and problem-solving. These experiences have taught me valuable skills in teamwork, leadership, and technical problem-solving.

In the future, I aspire to study computer science and engineering at a leading university, where I can continue to making robots and developing new applications to be helpful to humanity. Outside of academics, I enjoy gaming, exploring new technologies, and working on personal programming, robotics and social responsibility projects.
