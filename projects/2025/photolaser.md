# PhotoLaser (Self Project)
In 9th grade, I collaborated with my physics teacher to create a prototype for a photogate physics experiment setup. Since commercial photogates are often too expensive for schools, I designed a cost-effective alternative using phototransistors and 5V red lasers. For the track where the object moves, we used photoblock material because it is easy to cut and assemble. I programmed an Arduino to measure the time between the triggering of two phototransistors. Using the fixed distance between the sensors, the Arduino calculates the average speed of the object.

This year, I plan to enhance the design by adding a railway system with small, specialized trains. To demonstrate perfectly elastic collisions, I will attach magnets to the wagons. For inelastic collisions, I will incorporate Velcro into the setup. Additionally, I will design a suspension system for the wagons to ensure they stay on the track and do not derail during experiments. These improvements will make the setup more interactive, reliable, and accessible for physics demonstrations in schools.
