## SAGAN ([UUV-TEKNOFEST](https://teknofest.org/en/competitions/unmanned-underwater-systems-competition/))

In my prep year, a friend introduced me to the Underwater Systems Competition and invited me to join their team. I became the programming lead for the 2023 and 2024 seasons, contributing to the development and functionality of our underwater vehicle.

In 2023, our team ranked 23rd in the competition finals, and in 2024, we improved significantly, achieving 7th place. During this time, I gained extensive knowledge about communication systems, MAVLink protocols, flight controllers, companion computers, QGroundControl (QGC), and hardware selection for underwater systems.

This year, I am excited to continue as part of the team, aiming to further enhance my technical skills and contribute to achieving even greater success.
