## Sweet Managers ([Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/))

During PMI projects, students create a scenario and then work to plan it effectively. For my project, I led my team in planning and organizing the production of 20 medovik cakes for a birthday event. As the team leader, I took responsibility for creating the cost plan, estimating expenses for production and delivery. This education helped me learn more things in resource management, financial planning, and teamwork, ensuring the successful execution of our plan.
