# What is FRC?

FRC, or the FIRST Robotics Competition, is the largest robotics competition designed exclusively for high school students. Organized by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), FRC presents a new challenge and game field every year. Teams from around the world compete to build the most efficient, fast, and reliable robots.<br>

In 2024, I founded my school's first FRC team. As the team captain and programming lead, I helped guide our team to significant success. In our rookie year, we won the Marmara Regional and advanced to the World Championship in Houston, Texas. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I had the opportunity to meet teams and individuals from all over the world, learn from others, and saw many new places.

Throughout the 2024 season, I (?) leadership, mechanics, electronics, programming, kinematics, and odometry, among many others. FRC didn't just improve my technical knowledge and skill but also improved my ability to collaborate and lead better.
