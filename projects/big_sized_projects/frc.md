# What is FRC?
<br>
FRC, or the FIRST Robotics Competition, is the largest robotics competition designed exclusively for high school students. Organized by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), FRC presents a new challenge and game field every year. Teams from around the world compete to build the most efficient, fast, and reliable robots.<br>
<br>
In 2024, I founded my school's first FRC team. As the team captain and programming lead, I helped guide our team to significant success. In our rookie year, we won the Marmara Regional and advanced to the World Championship in Houston, Texas. It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my lifeâ€”I had the opportunity to meet teams and individuals from all over the globe, learn from others, and explore new places.<br>
<br>
Throughout the 2024 season, I gained invaluable skills in leadership, mechanics, electronics, programming, kinematics, and odometry, among many others. These experiences not only enhanced my technical knowledge but also shaped my ability to collaborate and lead effectively.
