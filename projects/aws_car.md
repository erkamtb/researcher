## Remote-Controlled Car Using Cloud (Final Project of Bootcamp)

I developed a car that can be controlled remotely over the internet by utilizing AWS cloud services. For the project, I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the website interface and backend. On the cloud side, I implemented AWS IoT, Lambda, VPC, and API Gateway, while MQTT was used as the communication protocol.<br>

In the future, I plan to enhance this project by adding a live camera stream using AWS Kinesis Video Streams, which will enable real-time video feedback for users controlling the car.
