# Detection of Hate Speech on the Web Using Artificial Intelligence (TÜBİTAK 2204A)

Developed a Chrome extension that implements an AI-powered (Local Powered AI support will be added) censorship tool for detecting and filtering inappropriate messages on platforms like WhatsApp. The extension offers users the choice between utilizing a large language model (LLM) via API or running a local model for message analysis. Future improvements include expanding support to all websites and integrating functionality for analyzing and moderating YouTube video comments.
