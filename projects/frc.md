## FRC (First Robotics Competition)

FRC, or the FIRST Robotics Competition, is the largest robotics competition designed exclusively for high school students. Organized by FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), FRC presents a new challenge and game field every year. Teams from around the world compete to build the most efficient, fast, and reliable robots.<br>
<br>
In 2023, I founded my school's FRC team. As the team captain, programming lead, and driver, I learned how to work with my team and lead them to be succsessful. In our rookie year, we won the Marmara Regional and advanced to the World Championship in Houston, Texas. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I had the opportunity to meet teams and individuals from all over the world, learn from others and explore new places.<br>
<br>
Throughout the 2024 season, FRC improve my skills in programming, CAD, mechanics, and electronics, while also teaching me the value of teamwork and leadership. For 2025 season I am the team captain again.
